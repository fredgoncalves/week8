What is the role of the permanent magnet in a motor?
To create the magnetic field that generates the motion of the coil.

What is the role of the brushes in a DC motor?
To alternate the current that goes through the coil, making it react to the magnetic field in order to spin continuously.

Imagine you have a robot and want that robot to scan the room for obstacles to decide how to move around. You have a proximity sensor that measures distance. What type of motor might you use to rotate the proximity sensor to scan the room -- a DC motor, a stepper motor, or a servo motor? Why?
A stepper motor. As the robot is trying to "map" the room, it is important to keep track of the proximity sensor position, and the stepper motor allows for great position control.
